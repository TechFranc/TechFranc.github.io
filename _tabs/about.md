I am a dedicated Software Developer with a passion for creating innovative, efficient, and secure digital solutions. My expertise spans across business systems, web development, and ERP customization, with hands-on experience in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (AL language), PHP/Laravel, WordPress, WooCommerce, SQL Server, and MySQL.

Beyond development, I have a strong interest in cybersecurity ensuring that the solutions I build are not only functional but also resilient against threats. I actively pursue knowledge in secure coding practices, risk management, and system protection, aiming to integrate security into every stage of the software development lifecycle.

I thrive in collaborative environments where problem solving, continuous learning, and innovation are encouraged. My career goal is to contribute to impactful projects that improve business efficiency, strengthen security, and deliver outstanding user experiences.
